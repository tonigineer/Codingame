# Bot Programming

This repository contains bots programmed for the website [CodinGame](https://www.codingame.com).

## How to Prepare Code for the Web Browser IDE

To prepare the code as a single file for submission to the CodinGame web browser
IDE, use the `flatten.py` script from the root directory:

```sh
cd ./bot-programming/ultimate-tic-tac-tac
python ./bot-programming/flatten.py ultimate-tic-tac-toe
```

This will generate a flattened version of the code suitable for the IDE.
